# DQN Lunar Lander: Uni Project Edition ðŸŒ™ðŸš€

Hey everyone! This repo is all about beating the Lunar Lander game using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) approach, and yes, it's as cool as it sounds. We're using PyTorch to teach a computer to land a spaceship â€” talk about futuristic homework, right?

## What's Inside:
- **DQNNetwork**: The brain of the operation. It's a PyTorch model that decides every move our lander makes. Three layers of neural network goodness with some ReLU to keep things smooth.
- **ReplayBuffer**: Think of this as the lander's diary, where it writes down all it's done. Good or bad, every experience is a lesson here.
- **DQNAgent**: The pilot, navigator, and the learner, all rolled into one. This class houses our DQN agent that uses the network and the buffer to learn how to not crash and burn.
- **Train Loop**: Where all the magic happens. We put our agent through the wringer here, training it across multiple episodes to improve its landing strategies.

## Training Log:
It's like a reality TV show but for AI. Watch our agent go from clumsy to graceful (hopefully). We've got scores, episodes, and some nerdy graphs to show off the progress.

## How to Get Started:
1. **Clone this repo**: Grab the code and get everything set up on your machine.
2. **Dependencies**: Run the first "Install and Import the Required Libraries" cell in the notebook to install the necessary libraries.
3. **Take it for a spin**: Jump into the code, start training, and see how well you can teach this AI to land.
4. **For better compatibility, run this code on Google Colab.***

## Join the Crew:
Whether you're here to learn, critique, or just because you're procrastinating on your actual assignments (we've all been there), your input is welcome! Feel free to fork, submit issues, or pull requests. Let's make this project something worth bragging about in class.

**TL;DR**: We're teaching a computer to land a spaceship using some fancy AI, and you're invited to join the fun. Let's make our CS profs proud.

## Quick Commands:
- Clone: `git clone https://github.com/gabriosilva/lunar-lander`

Catch you on the lunar surface! ðŸŒ‘âœ¨
